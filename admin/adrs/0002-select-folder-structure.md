# Selecting an Architecture/Folder Structure for our Toolkit

## Context and Problem Statement

Our group needed to decide on what file structure to use to start working on our project

## Considered Options

* IFrame Design
  - Creating an Iframe for every component of our toolkit
  - Similar to an Angular JS folder structure
  - Very Modular
  - Easy to compartmentalize 
* React-like Design
  - No separate HTML files, included in JS
  - Cohesive and fewer files to maintain
  - Less Setup

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: React-like Design
Decided against the IFrame deisgn because Iframe creates a new tab everytime and can lead to wasted resources. Hence, we will move on from that structure and continue to explore the react-like structure and potentially other newer ones.
