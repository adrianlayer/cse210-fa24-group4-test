# Initial Web Design

## Context and Problem Statement

For the project, we need a core idea of the web design before we can create our 1st iteration.

## Considered Options

* Slider + Toolbox
  - A slider on the left with a list of all of the tools, and a toolbox that takes up the right where the tools pop up.
* Slider + "Sandbox" toolbox
  - The same slider design, but a toolbox where each tool is a window that can be moved, resized, etc.
* Ugly
  - A crude and simple design, one that we can change later and evolve based on our needs.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 'Ugly'. After a discussion with our Professor, we decided that for our first iteration we should not worry about style and structure and instead get a working MVP. From there we can iterate and "fail fast" into our desired design.
